# Newicon is you

Everyone working at Newicon represents Newicon.  A person judges a company based on their interactions with people and the technology of that company.
The best restaurant in the world can be ruined by the font of house staff. It doesn't matter how good the food is if the waiter is rude.
The same is true for all bsuiness.  The same is true at Newicon, and we recognise that fact.

It means empathising with a customer and taking the time to get the writing right and consider how you’d feel if you were on the other side of the interaction.

This means marketing is also everyones responsibility.
