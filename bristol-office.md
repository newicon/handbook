Since Covid we have been working remotely. We have also hired outside of Bristol and will continue to hunt down the best talent globally.
Many of our core team memers are still Brstol based.

Why we love Bristol:

## It's Arty
Bristol is famous for making streat art take a world wide stage. 
- Banksy
- Aardman (Wallace and Gromit)

## It's Techy.
With many large and small innovation industries such as Airbus, Rolls Royce and BAE Systems.
Bristol Aeroplane Company was one of the first and most important British aviation companies.
It was where Concorde was made.

## There Be Pirates
Oooh arr, Bristal's history is famous for pirates and Edward Teach of Black Beard fame resided here.

The blend of art, science and technology mixed with a pinch of rebellion - is the perfect place to start a cutting edge [software development company](https://newicon.net).

## Second Einstein
Paul Dirac famously went to school and grew up in Bristol.  The Dirac equation unified reletivity and quantum mechanics and the symetry of the Dirac equation predicted anti matter particles.  These were later discovered.
