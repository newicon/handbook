Since Covid we have been working remotely. We have also hired outside of Bristol and will continue to hunt down the best talent globally.
Many of our core team memers are still Brstol based.

Why we love Bristol:

## It's Arty
Bristol is famous for making streat art take a world wide stage.

## It's Techy.
With many large and small innovation industries such as Airbu, Rolls Royce and BAE Systems.
Bristol Aeroplane Company was one of the first and most important British aviation companies.
It is arguably the birth place of the concorde.

## There Be Pirates
Oooh arr, Bristal's history is famous for pirates and Edward Teach of Black Beard fame resided here.

The blend of art, science and technology mixed with a pinch of rebellion - is the perfect place to start a cutting edge [software company](https://newicon.net).
